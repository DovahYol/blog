### Choosing I/O
When to use standard I/O
- When working with disk or terminal files
When to use raw I/O
- Inside signal handlers, because Unix I/O is async-signal-safe
- In rare cases when you need absolute highest performance
When to use RIO
- When you are dealing and writing network sockets
- Avoid using standard I/O on sockets
